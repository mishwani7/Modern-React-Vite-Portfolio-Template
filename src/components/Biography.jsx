          that values simplicity, education, and integrity. Growing up in
          the peaceful valleys of Chitral gave me a calm nature, but even as
          a child, I had a spark of curiosity. I always wondered how things
          worked, especially machines and technology. I still remember the
          first time I saw a computer in real life. It was like magic to me.
          I didn't just want to use it, I wanted to understand how it
          worked.

          started learning the building blocks like HTML, CSS, and

          technologies like React, PHP, Laravel, and WordPress. I didn't
