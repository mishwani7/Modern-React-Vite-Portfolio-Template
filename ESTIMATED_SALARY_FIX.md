# Rich Results Fix - Estimated Salary Issue

## Issue Resolved

**Problem**: Invalid object type for field "estimatedSalary" in Occupation schema

**Error Details**:

- The previous structure used `MonetaryAmount` with `QuantitativeValue` which is not the correct format for estimated salary data
- Missing `lastReviewed` field in `mainEntityOfPage`

## Solution Applied

### Before (Incorrect):

```json
"estimatedSalary": {
  "@type": "MonetaryAmount",
  "currency": "USD",
  "value": {
    "@type": "QuantitativeValue",
    "minValue": 30000,
    "maxValue": 60000,
    "unitText": "YEAR"
  }
}
```

### After (Correct):

```json
"estimatedSalary": [
  {
    "@type": "MonetaryAmountDistribution",
    "name": "base",
    "currency": "USD",
    "duration": "P1Y",
    "percentile10": 25000,
    "percentile25": 35000,
    "median": 45000,
    "percentile75": 55000,
    "percentile90": 65000
  }
],
"mainEntityOfPage": {
  "@type": "WebPage",
  "url": "https://mishwani.is-a.dev/",
  "lastReviewed": "2025-06-13"
}
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **Corrected Estimated Salary Structure**:

   - Changed from `MonetaryAmount` to `MonetaryAmountDistribution`
   - Added proper percentile-based salary distribution
   - Used ISO 8601 duration format (`P1Y` for 1 year)
   - Provided realistic salary ranges for software engineer position

2. **Enhanced mainEntityOfPage**:
   - Added `lastReviewed` field with current date
   - This helps Google understand when the occupation data was last updated
